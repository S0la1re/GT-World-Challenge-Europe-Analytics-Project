# Portfolio-Project
In this project, I am going to obtain data about races using web scraping from the "gt world challenge europe" website (https://www.gt-world-challenge-europe.com/results) and convert them into CSVs.

At the moment, the code is not working correctly. On 05/03/2024, the code stopped working. The source of the problem is currently unknown.
