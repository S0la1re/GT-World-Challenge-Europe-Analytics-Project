# GT World Challenge Europe Data Analysis
This project is designed to determine the most optimal GT3 car for participating in [GT World Challenge Europe](https://www.gt-world-challenge-europe.com/results) for 2024 season, using data from the last three years. An optimal car should consistently provide the highest and most reliable results across all tracks. By leveraging data from the past three seasons (2021, 2022, and 2023), we aim to identify which cars consistently dominated the championship and which excelled on particular tracks during the 2023 season.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main parts:

### Web Scraping
Data for the analysis was collected using web scraping techniques from the GT World Challenge Europe website. This step includes writing and executing scripts to extract race results, car specifications, and other relevant information about each car and race.

### Data Cleaning
After extracting the raw data, the next step was to clean and organize it to ensure accuracy and usability for analysis. This process included:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing or inconsistent data
- Standardizing car names and track information

### Data Analysis
The cleaned dataset was then analyzed to identify the most optimal car. Key goals included:
- Finding which cars consistently performed best overall across the past three seasons (2021, 2022, and 2023)
- Determining which cars showed dominance on each specific track during the 2023 season
- The analysis results were then compiled to provide a clear recommendation of the best car to use for participation in the GT World Challenge Europe in the 2024 season.
