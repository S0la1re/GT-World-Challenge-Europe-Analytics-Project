# GT World Challenge Europe Analytics Project

Welcome to the GT World Challenge Europe Analytics Project! This end-to-end project, designed for a Data Analyst portfolio, leverages the power of web scraping to extract race results data from various European racing circuits as featured on https://www.gt-world-challenge-europe.com/results.

## Project Objective

Our primary goal is to analyze and determine which cars dominate on specific tracks and identify the most versatile vehicles. These cars are expected to consistently perform well across all championship circuits, considering only the data from the 2023 season.

## Note
At the moment, the code in "Retrieving_data.ipynb" not working correctly. On 05/03/2024, the code stopped working. The source of the problem is currently unknown.
